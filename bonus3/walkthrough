Once we are logged as bonus3

We are presented with a suid binary.

After analysing the executable we find that the program calls fopen to open the file in /home/user/end/.pass

Then it's preparing two buffer to copy it's content in them. Also it reads the argument with atoi to put '\0' at that position.
Then strcmp buffer and the argv[1] together and runs a shell if they are equall.

If we input an empty string as first argument, it will replace the first character in the buffer with a \0.
Then strcmp will return 0.
